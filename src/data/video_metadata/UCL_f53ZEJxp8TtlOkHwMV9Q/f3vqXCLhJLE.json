 "title": "Background to Lecture VIII: Abrahamic Stories, with Matthieu & Jonathan Pageau",
 "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3vqXCLhJLE",
 "date": "2017-07-19",
 "description": "I had this 90 minute discussion with Jonathan Pageau, carver of Orthodox icons (http://www.pageaucarvings.com/index.html) and YouTube broadcaster (https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan), as well as his brother Matthieu, who  recently finished a draft of a book on the bible. I did so as part of the background research I was doing for the 8th lecture in my series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. We talked about the nature of the narrative landscape of the Bible, focusing on the Abrahamic stories, which constitute the subject material for that 8th and other forthcoming lectures.\n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.
