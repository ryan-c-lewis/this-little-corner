That's why you see [division and] the rise in powerful political ideologies\" JP\n[23:32] On the perversion of the religious instinct\n[25:41] The Bible's warning in Noah and the tower of Babel\n[30:43] Time before consciousness\n[36:43] \"Matter at the quantum level makes it difficult to think of a universe without conscious observers\" JP \n[40:45] Are science and religion at odds? \n[44:00] Dr. Petrusek on science/religion\n[46:31] On Faith\n[54:52] Imitating the spirit of the Father\n[54:56] \"You can conceptualize Christ as the representation of all things admirable.\" JP\n[57:53] \"Faith is the willingness to act that out in the world\" JP\n[01:00:27] Why we must strive to be good\n[01:01:12] \"I am loved and I wish to love, and I recognize that I will fail time and time again\" Matthew Petrusek\n[01:05:26] Evolution and religion\n[01:11:09] The creation of the universe\n[01:11:36] The church and Dr. Peterson's popularity\n[01:15:41] \"Faith cannot oppose reason\" MP\n[01:16:48] The challenge of drawing younger people to church\n[01:33:31] Acting as if God exists\n[01:36:37] \"Your life isn\u2019t about you and your own thoughts\" MP\n[01:39:46] \"When people fall in love with one another, they see the perfection that could conceivably exist. It's like the curtains of illusion pull apart momentarily, and you see the paradisal state that could be there\" JP\n[01:40:10] God's love and the love between a parent and a child\n[01:43:07] How to treat those we love\n[01:43:29] \"The more love you view other people with, the higher the moral demand that\u2019s placed on you\" JP\n[01:44:25] \u201cI think there\u2019s too much moral authority in the church\" JP\n[01:44:39] The ten commandments; the moral load of sin\n[01:49:25] Understanding hell\n[01:55:22] More on Word on Fire\n[01:58:04] The Exodus lectures\n\n#Christianity #Evolution
