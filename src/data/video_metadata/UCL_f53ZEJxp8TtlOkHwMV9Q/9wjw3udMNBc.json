We get into the difficulty of change in universities, anonymous reporting, the dangers of limiting free speech, microaggressions, the importance of humor, and more.\n\nArif Ahmed MBE is a philosopher, lecturer at Cambridge, and author of \u201cSaul Kripke\u201d. His interests include decision theory and religion from an atheist and libertarian point of view. In the aftermath of the Cambridge incident, Dr. Ahmed remained a vocal advocate for political diversity. \n\nDr. James Orr is a university lecturer in philosophy of religion at Cambridge and author of \u201cThe Mind of God and the Works of Nature.\u201d He is a regular contributor to The Times Literary Supplement and The Critic.\n\nDr. Ahmed\u2019s profile:\nhttps://phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/ahmed\n\n\u201cSaul Kripke\u201d:\nhttps://amazon.com/Kripke-Bloomsbury-Contemporary-American-Thinkers/dp/0826492622\n\nDr. Orr\u2019s profile:\nhttps://divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-james-orr\n\n\u201cThe Mind of God and Works of Nature\u201d:\nhttps://amazon.co.uk/Mind-God-Works-Nature-Philosophical/dp/9042937629\n\n_______________\nTimestamps \n_______________\n[00:00] Intro \n[01:13] The Cambridge repeal\n[09:41] A case for the repealers, their potential fears\n[10:19] Photos \u201cdon\u2019t imply a position\u2014that was one of the most outrageous things, \u2018endorsement by association\u2026\u2019 As if standing next to someone implies [you\u2019re in agreement]\" - Dr. Ahmed\n[14:11]  Changes in free speech policy \n[19:54] Speaking Up: Consequences\n[25:28] The difficulty of change in university\n[27:36] \u201cYou become what you practice\u201d - Jordan Peterson\n[27:45] \u201cIf you put off fights, they don't usually get better\u201d - Jordan Peterson\n[35:53] Being Silent: Perils\n[36:04] \u201cIn general, with any coercive principle, think what might happen in the hands of someone wicked and tyrannical. That's how we should think about these things\u201d - Dr. Ahmed\n[41:46] \"The idea that you should remove everything that could threaten someone's identity and you should make that a university-wide policy is actually, exactly the opposite of what you should do, speaking clinically if you're trying to help people become more resilient\" - Dr. Peterson\n[44:32] Microaggressions and the importance of humor\n[44:33] \"There\u2019s no such thing as a joke that isn't a microaggression. Jokes aren't funny unless they're microaggressions\u2013especially witty ones\" - Dr. Peterson\n[47:19] Anonymous voting & reporting\n[49:52] \"Politics is downstream from culture [and, for better or worse,] culture is generated in universities\" - Dr. Peterson\n[49:59] \u201cWhat happens on campus doesn't stay on campus\" - Dr. Orr\n[50:50] \"The point about anonymous reporting is that... you can't come back to them to check their evidence. The person who has been accused can't face their accuser. There\u2019s no possibility of due process\u201d - Dr. Ahmed\n[54:51] Anonymous reports circumventing due process\n[57:55] Tyranny & Free Speech\n[59:17] Details about the vote; university bureaucracy\n[01:05:56] UK legislation post-Cambridge  \n[01:13:06] Anti-education & ideological purity tests at university\n[01:15:36] \"I've heard students say \u2018Well, I just write what the professor wants...\u2019 It's like no \u2013 writing is thinking and if you don't think, that becomes part of you \u2013 those words become part of you [and] that's not bad education, it's anti-education\" - Dr. Peterson\n\n#Education #Cambridge #Microaggressions #Ideology #FreeSpeech\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nInterested in sponsoring my audio podcast?
