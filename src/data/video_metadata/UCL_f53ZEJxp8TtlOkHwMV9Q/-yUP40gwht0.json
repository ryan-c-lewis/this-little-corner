 "date": "2017-08-19",
 "description": "In this, the final lecture of the Summer 2017 12-part series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,  we encounter, first, Hagar's banishment to the desert with Ishmael and then the demand made by God to Abraham for the sacrifice of Isaac.\n\nTo sacrifice now is to gain later: perhaps the greatest of human discoveries. What, then, should best be sacrificed? And what might be the greatest gain? There are few eternal questions more profound and difficult.\n\nIn this lecture, I read an excerpt from Chapter 7 of my new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, now available for pre-order at Amazon.ca (http://amzn.to/2wkb7MY) and Amazon.com (http://amzn.to/2x1hfXF). \n\nI am currently making arrangements to continue this series with a monthly lecture. That will start in September at a date and time yet to be announced. \n\nProducer Credit and thanks to the following $200/month Patreon supporters.
