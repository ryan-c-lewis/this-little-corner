In it, I present the story of Joseph who, as the wearer of the coat of many colors, is profoundly adaptable, courageous, adaptable, merciful and just. Even in slavery -- even in prison -- he comes out triumphant, because of the strength of his character and his wisdom. Betrayed by his brothers, he acts to strengthen his family; unjustly accused by the Pharaoh's wife, he maintains his faith. \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support:
