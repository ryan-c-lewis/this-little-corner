Why are people so inclined to engage in conflict to protect their belief systems?\n\nIt's partly because our belief systems are not only systems of belief, but structures that serve to render everyone who participates in that belief and its dramatization and acting out in the world predictable, trustworthy and cooperative (even when competing). \n\nIs there a hierarchy of rank or value among belief systems, or are they merely arbitrary? \n\nWhat is the relationship between descriptions of the objective world and moral guidelines? How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?) \n\nWhat inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society? How is all this related to the underlying symbolic structures (religious structures) that sit at the base of our societies and belief structures? \n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 8756, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "I", "start": 11.549, "duration": 1.781}, {"text": "Started that I started the beginning of the class", "start": 13.33, "duration": 3.35}, {"text": "three months ago talking to you about", "start": 18.46, "duration": 2.239}, {"text": "What it what the problem was that I was trying to address?", "start": 22.329, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and", "start": 27.399, "duration": 1.621}, {"text": "The fundamental problem was the problem of belief systems", "start": 29.02, "duration": 3.199}, {"text": "and", "start": 32.86, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "the issue is was", "start": 34.87, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "what precisely constitutes a belief system and", "start": 38.8, "duration": 2.54}, {"text": "Then a secondary question was why are people so inclined to", "start": 43.36, "duration": 5.93}, {"text": "even engage in conflict to Maintain and Expand their belief systems", "start": 50.92, "duration": 4.16}, {"text": "and then maybe a sub question of that and is there an alternative to conflict with regards to belief systems and", "start": 56.8, "duration": 5.959}, {"text": "then the last issue", "start": 63.909, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "Was something like well.
