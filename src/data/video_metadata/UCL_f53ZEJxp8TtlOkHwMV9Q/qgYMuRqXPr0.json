 "description": "This episode was recorded on November 10th, 2021.\n\nIn this episode, philosopher Mohammed Hijab joined me to discuss a wide array of topics, such as the traditionalist interpretation of Islam, its metanarrative, the story of the prophet Muhammad, and some common ground among monotheistic Abrahamic religions.\n\nMohammed Hijab is an author and philosopher whose main interests lie in political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and comparative religion. He seeks to spread a better understanding of traditionalist Islam while engaging with prominent thinkers and philosophers worldwide.\n\nFind more from Mohammed Hijab on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/mohammed_hijab\n\n[00:00] Intro\n[01:48] What beliefs and practices are central to Islam?\n[04:12] Islam\u2019s unmoved mover argument for God and the universe\n[07:30] \u201cThings made of parts... must be contingent on being created by something else, a sorting mechanism [that] doesn\u2019t necessitate [creation itself].\u201d Mohammed Hijab\n[08:25] \u201cIt is problematic, through the lens of Islam... for there to be a god of a triune nature like [in] Christianity.\u201d MH\n[08:58] \u201cIslam does not believe that there\u2019s an element of divinity... in human beings.\u201d MH\n[10:09] \u201cThe word Islam does not mean peace; it means submission. Islam believes that everything in the universe submits to God.\u201d MH\n[10:57] The metanarrative of Islam\n[12:12] Mohammed\u2019s view of worship and belief\n[12:48] \u201cWe believe in... the inherent belief in God implanted in humans.\u201d MH\n[15:20] What\u2019s the purpose of belief?\n[17:00] The instinct for God arguments vs new atheists\n[18:27] The Muslim ideal for worship, compared\n[24:36] Muslims and Christians as followers of Jesus Christ\n[27:59] How does Dr. Peterson envision the spark of divinity?\n[28:25] \u201cThe divine spark is embodied virtue... reflective of the highest value, operating at a local scale.\u201d JP\n[29:42] How are the attributes of God knowable to a Muslim? The importance of the original version of the Quran\n[35:07] \u201cIslam is an evangelizing religion... we want everyone to embrace it.\u201d MH\n[35:31] Bridges to Islam\n[38:50] \u201cI\u2019m speaking from the perspective of someone who\u2019s a traditionalist Muslim and not a liberal or enlightened Muslim.\u201d MH\n[40:47] An abridged story of the prophet Muhammad. The Mecca and Medina periods. Rationalizing the warrior emphasis of many Muslim teachings\n[44:10] Muhammad\u2019s warrior traits and Hijab\u2019s interpretation\n[49:20] Exploring the terms \u201cwarlord\u201d and \u201cdefensive wars.\u201d\n[50:54] In Hijab\u2019s opinion, what\u2019s the central driving force behind the expansion of Islam?\n[52:10] \u201cIslam has the capability of being expansive through war... and of making peace treaties. It does and should do whatever\u2019s in its best interest, just like every country.\u201d MH\n[55:39] Against totalitarianism\n[58:46] \u201cEvangelising isn\u2019t the same as compelling.\u201d MH\n[58:56] \u201cLet the best story win. I would say that the proper mode of conversion is something like a shining example.\u201d JP\n[01:00:28] M.Hijab on western misconceptions of Islam\n[01:03:20] Other seldom-discussed aspects of Islam\n[01:08:53] M.Hijab\u2019s take on the war in Serbia\n[01:11:05] The economic output of Islamic countries\n[01:15:18] M.Hijab on why the traditionalist view is superior to a liberal one\n[01:21:34] The struggles of belief. How can we check our own views?\n[01:23:44] Wrapping up\n\n#Islam #Christianity #God #Quran #Jesus\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",
