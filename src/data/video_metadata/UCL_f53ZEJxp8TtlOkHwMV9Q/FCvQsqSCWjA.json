 "description": "This episode was recorded on September 10th 2021.\n\nJordan Peterson, Bishop Barron, John Vervaeke, and Jonathan Pageau have a round table to explore ideas and theories of Meaning. All three guests have been on the podcast before, and all share Jordan\u2019s passion for the universal truths of human experience. This deep discussion explores the roots of Meaning and religious significance.\n\nBishop Barron is the founder of Word on Fire and the auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of LA.\n\nJohn Vervaeke is a colleague of Jordan\u2019s and an associate professor at the University of Toronto since 1994. He teaches courses on reasoning, cognitive development, and higher cognitive processes.\n\nJonathan Pageau is a symbolic thinker, YouTuber, and class carver of orthodox icons.\n\n-\n\nFind more Bishop Barron on YouTube:  https://youtube.com/user/wordonfirevideo\nAnd here: https://wordonfire.org/\n\nFind more John Vervaeke online on his website: http://johnvervaeke.com\nJohn's YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/channel/UCpqDUjTsof-kTNpnyWper_Q\n\nFind more Jonathan Pageau on YouTube: https://youtube.com/channel/UCtCTSf3UwRU14nYWr_xm-dQ \nJonathan's website: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\n\n_________\n[00:00] Preview\n[01:30] Intro\n[02:40] Everyone gives their answer to \u201cWhat is meaning?\u201d\n[03:30] \u201cWe're using meaning as a metaphor... something similar to the way a sentence works. It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it\u201d Jon Vervaeke\n[07:22] \u201cOur mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure\" JV\n[09:10] \u201cWhen you look at the world there is a central point of focus. When you focus on the point with your eyes it becomes very clear... until we no longer perceive anything by the edge of our vision. It's nothingness, it's just not there\" Jordan Peterson\n[13:56] Bishop Barron's view on meaning and religion\n[14:23] \u201cI would say that meaning is to be in a purposeful relationship to a value\" Bishop Robert Barron\n[17:55] \u201cSo I'm talking to you, which I believe is a good, but it's nested in a higher good and a still higher good, so finally I want not just this particular good but good itself\u2014that's a religious relationship\" BRB\n[18:20] Pageau\u2019s opening thoughts on meaning and religion\n[19:56] \u201cThe reason we perceive hierarchy is because we are always judging... or trying to evaluate whether something\u2019s good\" Pageau\n[20:31] Jordan\u2019s brief foray into \u201cmini-celebrations\u201d\n[21:53] The idea of revelation\n[24:46] \u201cIt isn't obvious to me that we see objects\u2014we see patterns\" JP\n[27:40] \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u2014it wasn't the first song I liked, but it was the first that rocked my world and rearranged my mind, and I think that's where real value is\" BRB\n[28:42] Underlying causes of the crisis of meaning\n[30:10] \u201cSomething that starts with Scotus... and goes into the heart of the scientific revolution is that there\u2019s no such thing as levels\u2014reality just is\" JV\n[31:00] Science around the hierarchy of intelligibility and connectedness\n[33:00] What is science?\n[39:00] \u201cThere\u2019s an epistemic hierarchy and science does not belong on the top\" BRB\n[42:00] \u201cAs scientists, we are motivated by a narrative we don't understand scientifically\u2026 The whole enterprise is driven by a dream whose reality can't be encapsulated within the process itself\" JP\n[44:00] The ignorance in assuming science OR religion are correct\n[44:40] Eminationist ontologies\n[55:30] Religious experiences\n[01:07:30] The book of Revelations as a psychedelic experience.\n[01:17:30] The Psychedelic problem and why psychedelics are useful in communal experiences.\n[01:26:00] Jordan\u2019s biblical lectures\n[01:32:00] What are the guests working on?\n[01:36:00] Beauty in churches\n[01:38:00] Growing up Christian\n[01:44:00] Possibility is real\n[01:50:00] Joining religion and science\n[01:58:04] Wrapping up\n\n#Meaning #Psychology #Religion\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: \nhttps://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n// SPONSORS //\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast",
