He has published over 100 scholarly papers, co-edited three books on existential psychology, and written several books, including Nostalgia: A Psychological Resource, Supernatural: Death, Meaning, and the Power of the Invisible World. \n\nA lot of Dr. Routledge\u2019s work - like Dr. Peterson's - focuses on the need for meaning.
