 "description": "This episode was recorded on May 18th 2021.\n\nJordan Peterson and Dr. Stephen Blackwood discuss his work as a founder of an inner-city youth program and his experience with developing Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia. They have a rich discussion about the philosophical underpinnings of human flourishing, the University and the humanities, the spiritual-intellectual crisis of our times, and more. \n\nDr. Blackwood specializes in the history of philosophy and dedicates a large portion of his work and studies to the ancient Roman philosopher-poet, Boethius. He was one of the founders of St. George's YouthNet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and is the founding president of Ralston College.\n\nDr. Blackwood\u2019s website: https://www.stephenjblackwood.com/\nRalston College's website: https://www.ralston.ac/\n\nThe Jordan B.
