These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are). In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing on our current frame), and determine emotional significance (positive: things that move us along; negative: things that get in our way).\n\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\n\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\n\n--- BOOKS ---\n\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\n\n--- LINKS ---\n\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\n\n--- PRODUCTS ---\n\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson", "duration": 8549, "transcript_parts": [{"text": "Now that you've had an opportunity to walk through a narrative", "start": 11.72, "duration": 3.76}, {"text": "then, hopefully, some of the things that I'm going to say, that are more technical, will make more sense", "start": 15.48, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "and so, what we're going to do today, at least in part, is to deal with...", "start": 22.28, "duration": 4.58}, {"text": "to start to deal with conceptualizing a solution", "start": 26.86, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "to the fact that the world is too complex to properly perceive", "start": 32.46, "duration": 4.8}, {"text": "so what the problem fundamentally is is that there's a lot more of everything else than there is of you", "start": 37.26, "duration": 6.44}, {"text": "especially if you include in that everything else, all the parts of you that you also don't understand", "start": 43.7, "duration": 6.64}, {"text": "and so...", "start": 50.34, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "I want to walk you through how I think we solve that, at least in part", "start": 53.54, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "and we do that by, essentially by simplifying the world, but", "start": 58.76, "duration": 3.96}, {"text": "I think mostly that we simplify it as a place in which to act, rather than a place in which to perceive objects", "start": 62.72, "duration": 9.48}, {"text": "and I really believe that there's a critical distinction between those two things", "start": 72.2, "duration": 4.84}, {"text": "and I think that part of the reason that there's been continual tension", "start": 77.04, "duration": 5.12}, {"text": "say, between the claims of science and, let's say, the claims of religion", "start": 82.16, "duration": 4.22}, {"text": "is because the idea that the world as a place of objects and as a place to act have to be considered separately, isn't properly understood", "start": 86.38, "duration": 10.68}, {"text": "I don't know...", "start": 97.06, "duration": 2.64}, {"text": "so I'm gonna try to straighten that up to the degree that that's possible", "start": 99.7, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "so, I'm gonna talk to you about stories and meta-stories", "start": 104.14, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "and the story, I would say, is the simplest unit of useful information", "start": 107.86, "duration": 6.06}, {"text": "with regards to action and perception that you can be offered", "start": 113.92, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "and then a meta-story is a story about how a story like that transforms", "start": 117.4, "duration": 4.44}, {"text": "and I would say...", "start": 121.84, "duration": 2.62}, {"text": "we'll concentrate on the structure of the story", "start": 124.46, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "and then we'll get into the structure of the meta-story, and", "start": 129.24, "duration": 4.18}, {"text": "that'll constitute today's... today's class", "start": 133.42, "duration": 5.0}, {"text": "so the first thing I wanna show you...

"duration": 6.82}, {"text": "yeah, that's right... noted was that if he...", "start": 312.36, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "if I sat you down, for example, and I put some headphones on you", "start": 316.56, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "and I played a tone to you that repeated, exactly the same tone that repeated at predictable intervals", "start": 320.0, "duration": 6.86}, {"text": "that the first time you heard the tone you'd produce quite a spike in skin conductance", "start": 326.86, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "and the next time a slightly smaller spike, and then the next time a slightly smaller spike", "start": 330.78, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "until after maybe you've heard it three or four times, you would not respond to it at all", "start": 335.02, "duration": 5.78}, {"text": "and that was often regarded as habituation", "start": 340.8, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "and habituations is the same thing that you can see in snails, for example", "start": 344.24, "duration": 4.2}, {"text": "and I'm using snails as an example, because they have very, very simple nervous systems", "start": 348.44, "duration": 5.2}, {"text": "so if you take a snail and you poke it, then...", "start": 353.64, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "like it comes out of its shell and you poke it, it'll go back into its shell", "start": 356.34, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "and then it'll come out, and if you poke it again it'll go back into its shell", "start": 359.52, "duration": 3.54}, {"text": "and it'll come out; but if you keep doing that, sooner or later the snail will just stop going in", "start": 363.06, "duration": 4.76}, {"text": "and you might think of that... it has been conceptualized as the simplest form of learning", "start": 367.82, "duration": 4.78}, {"text": "habituation", "start": 372.6, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "and the behaviorists tend to presume that if a human being manifested a response that could be modeled by a simple organism", "start": 374.6, "duration": 7.72}, {"text": "then the human being was using a response that was analogous to that of the simple organism", "start": 382.32, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "and sometimes that's true, and sometimes it's not, so...", "start": 386.92, "duration": 3.56}, {"text": "for example, you have simple reflexes that, you know", "start": 390.48, "duration": 2.66}, {"text": "if you put your hand on a hot stove, you'll jerk back, and that's quite a simple circuit", "start": 393.14, "duration": 4.04}, {"text": "you'll move your hand back before the message gets to your brain", "start": 397.18, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "because the spinal cord is smart enough to mediate a reflex like that all by itself", "start": 400.64, "duration": 5.98}, {"text": "so you know, your brains is actually quite distributed throughout your body, it's not just in your head like people tend to think", "start": 406.62, "duration": 5.56}, {"text": "and so, we have conserved fast-acting reflexes at various levels of our nervous system", "start": 412.18, "duration": 9.18}, {"text": "they aren't capable of sophisticated response, it's pretty much stimulus - response", "start": 421.36, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "thinking about it from the behavioral perspective", "start": 427.72, "duration": 2.0}, {"text": "but they have as an advantage incredible speed, because they're just aren't that many neural connections between the stimulus and the response", "start": 429.72, "duration": 6.44}, {"text": "and so, we have layers of response at different time frames", "start": 436.2, "duration": 5.52}, {"text": "that help us match with the demands of the external environment", "start": 441.72, "duration": 4.7}, {"text": "so Charles Darwin, for example, used to go into the, I think it was a museum in England, I don't remember the name of it", "start": 446.42, "duration": 5.38}, {"text": "the snake in there, I believe it was a cobra,", "start": 451.8, "duration": 2.54}, {"text": "and he'd stick his face up at the glass, and the cobra would strike at him", "start": 454.34, "duration": 3.46}, {"text": "and he'd jerk back; and he tried many, many times to master that reflexive response to the snake, but there was no way", "start": 457.8, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "every time that thing struck at him, he'd jump backwards", "start": 464.16, "duration": 3.44}, {"text": "well, you can imagine the survival utility in a reflex like that, but in reflexes in general", "start": 467.6, "duration": 5.66}, {"text": "okay, so back to Sokolov", "start": 473.26, "duration": 3.14}, {"text": "now, what he decided...", "start": 476.4, "duration": 2.76}, {"text": "if you took that tone, and you did anything to it that was perceptible", "start": 479.16, "duration": 3.92}, {"text": "right, because there's certain gradations of tone that you're not capable of perceiving", "start": 483.08, "duration": 5.36}, {"text": "but let's assume you took the tone, and you would adjust it enough so that it was perceptibly louder", "start": 488.44, "duration": 4.5}, {"text": "or it was perceptibly a different frequency, or something like that", "start": 492.94, "duration": 3.82}, {"text": "or even that the spaces between the tones", "start": 496.76, "duration": 2.82}, {"text": "'cause I said they were predictably spaced", "start": 499.58, "duration": 2.16}, {"text": "even if the spaces between the tones were changed", "start": 501.74, "duration": 3.52}, {"text": "then, when the change occurred, the orienting reflex would be reinstated, you'd respond to it again", "start": 505.26, "duration": 6.36}, {"text": "and Sokolov tried to vary the tone on many, many parameters", "start": 511.62, "duration": 4.56}, {"text": "but no matter what parameter he varied it on, as long as you could detect it perceptibly", "start": 516.18, "duration": 5.92}, {"text": "you'd produce an orienting reflex; so Sokolov's idea was that", "start": 522.1, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "you must be producing a complex internal model of the world", "start": 525.82, "duration": 4.24}, {"text": "that's in concordance with the world across pretty much every perceptible dimension", "start": 530.06, "duration": 4.64}, {"text": "because if you weren't doing that, how in the world would you know that the tone had changed from what you had already learned about it?", "start": 534.7, "duration": 7.22}, {"text": "and so, for the longest time, and this was also true for people who were investigating artificial intelligence", "start": 541.92, "duration": 5.7}, {"text": "we had this idea that what people did was make a complex model of the world, and hold it in their minds, so to speak", "start": 547.62, "duration": 6.56}, {"text": "and then they'd act in the world, and they compared what they expected to happen in the world with the model", "start": 554.18, "duration": 6.2}, {"text": "and as long as there was a match, then there was no orienting reflex", "start": 560.38, "duration": 3.1}, {"text": "now, the orienting reflex turns out to be quite a complex reflex, it's not merely an alteration in skin conductance", "start": 563.48, "duration": 5.86}, {"text": "what it is in essence is the manner in which you start to unfold your response to the unknown", "start": 569.34, "duration": 7.52}, {"text": "and the initial stages of that are very, very quick", "start": 576.86, "duration": 3.12}, {"text": "but it's hard to tell when the orienting reflex stops, and when more complex learning begins", "start": 579.98, "duration": 6.1}, {"text": "they sort of shade into one another", "start": 586.08, "duration": 2.14}, {"text": "so the initial stages of the orienting reflex are quite reflexive", "start": 588.22, "duration": 3.72}, {"text": "but the later stages can be extraordinarily complex, so for example...", "start": 591.94, "duration": 11.38}, {"text": "well, I always think the example of betrayal is the best one, because it's so complex", "start": 603.32, "duration": 5.98}, {"text": "so imagine that you know, you come home and you find evidence, lipstick or something like that", "start": 609.3, "duration": 6.1}, {"text": "evidence that the person that you're with is betraying you", "start": 615.4, "duration": 3.88}, {"text": "the first thing that's going to happen is that you're going to orient, there's going to be a real shock, and that's reflexive", "start": 619.28, "duration": 4.74}, {"text": "it's very much akin to the response that you would manifest if you saw a predator, or a snake, or something like that", "start": 624.02, "duration": 7.38}, {"text": "so that's very instantaneous, you know", "start": 631.4, "duration": 3.38}, {"text": "and then that'll prepare you for action, you'll get ready to do whatever it is that you need to do next", "start": 634.78, "duration": 5.6}, {"text": "a very unpleasant thing; but then", "start": 640.38, "duration": 2.7}, {"text": "it might take you even years to fully manifest the learning that would be necessary in a situation like that", "start": 643.08, "duration": 7.08}, {"text": "because there's so many things that you have to reconsider", "start": 650.16, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "first of all, the person might now appear to you as a threat, that's pretty immediate", "start": 653.64, "duration": 4.26}, {"text": "so there's a biological, physiological response first, your body reacts first", "start": 657.9, "duration": 4.46}, {"text": "then you respond emotionally, that's gonna take a while, and you know, the emotional response might extend over days, or weeks, or months, or even years", "start": 662.36, "duration": 9.04}, {"text": "and then, as you're doing that as well, you're going to try to start to re-sort out your interpretive schema", "start": 671.4, "duration": 5.76}, {"text": "so that it can adjust to the transformation that this...", "start": 677.16, "duration": 4.9}, {"text": "this error on your part, say, or this catastrophe, or this betrayal", "start": 682.06, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "it has to adjust to whatever information that event contains", "start": 686.66, "duration": 4.36}, {"text": "and so the orienting reflex can manifest itself over an extraordinarily long period of time", "start": 691.02, "duration": 5.86}, {"text": "it's best to think about it as the initial part of what can be a very complex learning process", "start": 696.88, "duration": 6.22}, {"text": "now, that was a standard idea in psychology for the longest period of time", "start": 703.1, "duration": 7.14}, {"text": "that we created a detailed internal model of the world", "start": 710.24, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "and we watched how the world was unfolding, we compared the two", "start": 714.3, "duration": 4.28}, {"text": "and the physiology, the neurophysiology of this was even understood to some degree, even by the Russians", "start": 718.58, "duration": 5.9}, {"text": "in the early 1960s, because they basially localized...", "start": 724.48, "duration": 3.2}, {"text": "you could use complex EEG, electroencephalogram technology", "start": 727.68, "duration": 4.6}, {"text": "to localize where the orienting reflex was occurring in the brain, and basically it appeared to occur, roughly speaking, in the hippocampus", "start": 732.28, "duration": 7.28}, {"text": "and the theory arose that your brain, your cortex, let's say, produced a very complex model of the world", "start": 739.56, "duration": 6.16}, {"text": "an internal model; and your sense were producing a model of the external world", "start": 745.72, "duration": 4.66}, {"text": "and the hippocampus was watching those things to see if they matched", "start": 750.38, "duration": 4.1}, {"text": "and if they didn't match, there was a mismatch signal, and that would be the orienting reflex", "start": 754.48, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "and then your body would start to prepare itself for whatever that mismatch meant", "start": 758.54, "duration": 6.08}, {"text": "and then you would engage in exploratory behavior to try to update your model", "start": 764.62, "duration": 4.72}, {"text": "that was the standard theory, it was a very well accepted theory", "start": 769.34, "duration": 4.06}, {"text": "it has elements of cybernetic theory in it", "start": 773.4, "duration": 2.82}, {"text": "but it was accepted enough so that when people first started to experiment with artificial intelligence", "start": 776.22, "duration": 6.82}, {"text": "that's how they tried to make artificially intelligent systems", "start": 783.04, "duration": 2.94}, {"text": "they tried to make ones that would model the world, and then act, and then compare the changes in the world to that model", "start": 785.98, "duration": 6.3}, {"text": "but that didn't go anywhere, it turned out, because it turned out that", "start": 792.28, "duration": 3.3}, {"text": "it's so difficult to see and model the world that people had no idea how complex that was", "start": 795.58, "duration": 6.8}, {"text": "it was impossibly complex, as it turned out, and so that's part of the reason", "start": 802.38, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "we don't have

and we can just wander through it", "start": 819.4, "duration": 4.0}, {"text": "you know, and we don't even do that consciously to any great degree", "start": 823.4, "duration": 3.76}, {"text":

the world was waaay more difficult than anybody had guessed", "start": 832.3, "duration": 7.48}, {"text": "and then this experiment really in some sense put a phenomenological punch behind that observation", "start": 839.78, "duration": 9.04}, {"text": "because one of the presuppositions of the orienting reflex theory that I just laid out was that:", "start": 848.82, "duration": 6.24},

these different nuclei, that's what they're called", "start": 7458.1, "duration": 4.08}, {"text": "and they sort of correspond to those shapes that I showed you in the human hypothalamus earlier",

eating and drinking system, your reproductive system, and your defensive system, but", "start": 7523.7, "duration": 4.7}, {"text": "the problem is that those things, first of all, can conflict,",

conflict in the present", "start": 7543.34, "duration": 3.48}, {"text": "but then they can conflict with other people doing the same thing", "start": 7546.82, "duration": 3.66}, {"text": "and they can conflict across time", "start": 7550.48, "duration": 2.32}, {"text": "and so partly the reason that you need the rest of your brain is to solve the problems from the solutions that the hypothalamus offers", "start": 7552.8, "duration": 7.4}, {"text": "and so, because you don't wanna just eat and drink, and reproduce and defend yourself", "start": 7560.2, "duration": 6.14}, {"text": "you wanna eat now, later, tomorrow, next week, and next month", "start": 7566.34, "duration": 5.1}, {"text": "while you're able to engage in reproductive activity and defend yourself", "start": 7571.44,

your brain to calculate that", "start": 7580.84, "duration": 2.68}, {"text": "and so what the rest of your brain has to do, roughly speaking, is regulate these", "start": 7583.52, "duration": 6.04},
