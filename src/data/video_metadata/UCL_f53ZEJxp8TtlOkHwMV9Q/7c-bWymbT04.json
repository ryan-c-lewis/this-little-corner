 "description": "This podcast was recorded on May 14th, 2021.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode, Dr. Jordan Peterson is accompanied by author Brian Muraresku and Professor Carl Ruck to unravel the secrets of ancient Greek culture and religion. They embark upon the sinuous journey of discussing psychedelics in Ancient Greek religion, and how both Brian and Professor Ruck became deeply invested in understanding the subject. \n\nToday we meet with Brian Muraresku, who tells us why and how he was drawn to research the role of psychedelics within Western civilization. Muraresku is also the author of The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion With No Name.\n\nCarl Ruck is an American professor who\u2019s known for his extensive research on mythology and religion regarding the sacred role of entheogens; a selection of psychoactive plants that are known for inducing altered states of reality or consciousness. Ruck co-authored the book The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries, and is currently teaching mythology classes supporting this theory at Boston University.\n\nThe Jordan B. Peterson Podcast can be found at https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\n\nBrian Muraresku and Professor Carl Ruck\u2019s books:\n\nBrain Muraresku\u2019s The Immorality Key: https://www.amazon.com/Immortality-Key-Uncovering-History-Religion/dp/1250207142\n\nProfessor Carl Ruck\u2019s The Road to Eleusis:\nhttps://maps.org/images/pdf/books/eleusis.pdf\n\n[00:00] Introduction\n[4:00] Jordan begins the discussion with Muraresku on how he became interested in the subject of psychedelics in ancient Greek religion. \n[16:30] The story of Brian's 12-year journey to discover the secret mushroom religion of the ancient Greeks.\n[20:00] The idea that beer and ergot are the root psychedelic experience in the form of religious communal experience.\n[23:30] Facing death in Eleusis.\n[27:00] Overview on Brian's trips while researching for his book The Immortality Key.\n[33:00] Muraresku talks about whether or not he\u2019s found links to the origins of Christianity in his research.\n[46:30] Professor Carl Ruck joins. They discuss Ruck's co-authorship of The Road to Eleusis.\n[55:00] Distinguishing between visionary and hallucinogenic experiences. \n[1:04:00] The main thesis of The Road to Eleusis as described by Carl Ruck.\n[1:10:00] Shamanic tradition that echoes Greek myth, even Disney movies mirror the same elements of experience.\n[1:15:00] Public reactions to The Road to Eleusis.\n[1:25:30] Carl Ruck's experience with the kukiyon potion.\n[1:31:00] Recounting other psychedelic experiences of Carl Ruck.\n[1:36:30] The use of realizations achieved through psychedelic use.\n[1:44:00] Speculation on influential thinkers in Western culture that may have been affected by entheogenic substances.\n[1:46:00] Brian on not taking entheogenic substances after devoting so much of his life to its research.\n[1:49:30] Professor Ruck talks about what the relationship between Dionysus of Greek mythology and Christ is/was.\n\n#Psychedelics #Consciousness #Religion\n\nJordan B.
