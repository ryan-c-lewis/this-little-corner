We explore topics like niche-switching, what Darwin got wrong, Twitter, sources for modern values, hyper-novelty, the aftermath of progress, parenthood, and sexual selection \u2013 just to name a few.\nBret Weinstein and Heather Heying are evolutionary biologists, former Evergreen State College professors, and the current hosts of the DarkHorse podcast. You may also know Bret through Joe Rogan, or as the twice-moderator for Jordan\u2019s debates with Sam Harris. \nThe couple\u2019s book, titled \u201cA Hunter-Gatherer\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life,\u201d asks why the most prosperous age in history has scarcely offset suicide rates, tribal division, loneliness, and human misery.\n\nFollow Bret at: \nhttps://twitter.com/BretWeinstein\nAnd Heather at:\nhttps://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying \nThe DarkHorse Podcast: \nhttps://bretweinstein.net/podcast \n\nA Hunter-Gatherer\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life:\nhttps://amazon.com/gp/product/B08VF32DXK/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0 \n\n______________\nShownotes\n______________\n[00:00] Intro\n[00:30] Guests\u2019 background\n[01:32] A Hunter-Gatherer\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century \u2013 why they wrote it\n[04:30] \u201cValues might not be [scientifically] defensible. Taken to the extreme, it might be hard to explain why existing is better than not\" - Bret Weinstein\n[05:07] \u201cWe believe that any credible 'ought' needs to be scientifically informed\" - BW\n[05:45] Learning to negotiate hyper-novelty in the modern world. The extremely fast rate of progress and change\n[06:56] \u201cThe amazing rate of change we\u2019ve created is itself deranging us and making it very difficult to understand and remember how to be human\u201d - Heather Heying\n[08:18] \u201cIt's not that progress is bad \u2013 the benefit of progress is often tremendous, but it almost always comes with important unintended consequences\u201d - BW\n[09:26] Our incredible ability to adapt by \u201cniche-switching\u201d\n[15:41] Unintended consequences & modern sleeping\n[22:45] Twitter as a giant social experiment; what happens when you can (sort of) communicate with everyone?\n[25:22] \u201cIf people treated each other the way they do on Twitter, they\u2019d get beaten up with enough regularity to stop them. So the net effect [might make us] nicer, right?\u201d - BW\n[25:47] The importance of nonverbal communication; physical and chemical ways humans communicate\n[29:57] Small talk, gaging social skills, and nonverbal cues\n[31:28] \u201cSmall talk lets you take a room\u2019s temperature\u2013literally and metaphorically\" - Heather Heying\n[32:35] Objections to evolutionary theory: A critique of some key Darwinian tenets\n[38:28] Play & Evolution\n[42:08] Intelligence in mate selection amongst bowerbirds\n[53:12] How Heather conceptualizes male/female status hierarchies\n[55:57] Sex, gender, and how they\u2019re linked\n[01:06:44] The Hero's journey and the importance of new storytelling\n[01:13:42] The adaptive valley picture in evolutionary biology\n[01:13:46] \u201cI'm trying to update our understanding of stories rather than the stories themselves\" - Jordan Peterson\n[01:21:29] podcasts & collective listening\n[01:27:26] Parenting & Children\n[01:27:46] \u201cChildren will destroy your life and replace it with a better one\" - BW\n[01:28:52] Parenting & Relationships\n[01:30:03] Wrapping up\n\n#Biology #Evolution #Gender #P\u00e2renting #Darwin \n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL
